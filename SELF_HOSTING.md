Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

## Installing Dependencies
Navigate to the cloned repository's directory and run:
```
cd bandwidth-hero-proxy2
npm install
```

## Configuration
Set up the necessary environment variables or edit the configuration files as per the application's requirements. For example:
```
export NODE_ENV=production
export PORT=3000
```

## Starting the Server
To start the application server, you can use `node` directly:
```
node index.js
```
Or use a process manager like `pm2` for better process management:
```
npm install pm2 -g
pm2 start index.js --name bandwidth-hero-proxy
```

## Reverse Proxy Setup
If you're using Nginx, set up a reverse proxy by adding the following configuration to your Nginx site configurations:
```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```
Replace `example.com` with your domain and `3000` with the port your app is running on.

For Apache, use the following configuration:
```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName example.com
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:3000/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:3000/
</VirtualHost>
```
Again, replace `example.com` with your domain and `3000` with the port your app is running on.

## Post-Deployment
After deploying the application, ensure to monitor its performance and logs. You can use `pm2` to check the application logs:
